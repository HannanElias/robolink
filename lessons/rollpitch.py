Objectives:
 - Describe how roll and pitch change the droneâ€™s movement in the air.
 - Explain the difference between parameters and arguments when using functions.
 - Use the roll and pitch throttle commands to make the drone navigate a path of your choosing.
 - Incorporate your knowledge to build a full flight path for the drone, including takeoff and landing.

Steps:
- pairing
- takeoff
- set roll movement
- set speed and direction of movement
- hover
- land
