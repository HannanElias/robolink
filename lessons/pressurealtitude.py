Objectives:
 - Describe how roll and pitch change the droneâ€™s movement in the air.
 - Explain the difference between parameters and arguments when using functions.
 - Use the roll and pitch throttle commands to make the drone navigate a path of your choosing.
 - Incorporate your knowledge to build a full flight path for the drone, including takeoff and landing.

Steps:
- pairing
- set initial pressure
- manually change the height of the drone
- display the height based on barometric data
- hover
- land
