Objectives:
- Describe how roll, pitch, yaw, and throttle change the droneâ€™s movement in the air.
- Use the roll, pitch, yaw, and throttle commands to make the drone navigate a path of your choosing.
- Incorporate your knowledge of creating a complete program from Island 1 to build a full flight path for the drone, including takeoff and landing.

Steps:
- pairing
- takeoff
- throttle and yaw
- land
