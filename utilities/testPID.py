Key Points:
- Tuning the PID Gains:
    The Kp, Ki, and Kd gains need to be tuned carefully to achieve stable and
    responsive control.
- Time Step:
    The dt parameter in the calculate_output method represents the time interval
    between control cycles.
    It's important to choose an appropriate value to ensure accurate control.
- Saturation:
    To prevent excessive control signals, consider implementing saturation limits.
- Integration Windup:
    To avoid integral windup, you can limit the integral term or use anti-windup
    techniques.
    get_current_angles() is a place holder for codrone_edu equivalent function
    set_desired_angles() should translate the control outputs into appropriate
    commands for codrone_edu methods
- Noise Filtering:
    If the sensor measurements are noisy, you can apply filtering techniques
    (e.g., low-pass filter) to reduce noise.
- Real-World Considerations:
    Real-world factors like wind, air resistance, and motor dynamics can affect the drone's behavior. You may need to adjust the PID gains and control strategy to compensate for these factors.
